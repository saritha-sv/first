Guess the number function encaptulates the entire guessing game logic
it intializes variables for the lowee bound(low),upper bound(high), and number of attempts(attempts).
it prints intructions for the player to think of a number between 1 and 30
the game enters a loop that continues until the correct number is guessed.
Inside the loop, the computer generates a random guess between the current lower and upper bounds.
The loop continues until the correct number is guessed, at which point the loop breaks.
